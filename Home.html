        <p>When people watch movies, they usually look for relatable characters so they are able to connect with the movie.
          Movies screenings in the U.S. movie theaters and streaming platforms are notorious for being less inclusive when it comes to women and minority races.
          On the contrary, there have been a few recent movies that are minority based films that were heavily recgonized by the U.S. film industry and award shows.
          This includes Black Panther and Parasite and even the movie Birds of Prey showed how women are extradionary parts of a film.  All these movies were able to undeiable turn the heads of white Hollywood, but is Hollywood still too exclusive for comfort?
